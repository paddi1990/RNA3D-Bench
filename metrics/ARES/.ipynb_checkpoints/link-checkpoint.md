# ARES (Atomic Rotationally Equivariant Scorer)

## Overview

**ARES** is a deep learning–based scoring model for **evaluating RNA 3D structural models**.  
Rather than predicting RNA structures directly, ARES assesses the **quality of candidate RNA 3D models** and assigns a **single scalar score** to each model, where **lower scores indicate higher structural quality**.

ARES is designed to rank and evaluate RNA structures generated by external modeling methods, such as Rosetta or other RNA 3D structure prediction pipelines.

## Web Server and Software

- **ARES Web Server**

- **Source Code and Data (Zenodo)**

The web server provides direct access to the trained ARES model for structure evaluation.

## Method Description

ARES is a **neural network–based scoring function** trained to distinguish high-quality RNA 3D structures from less accurate ones.  
Given a set of candidate RNA models, ARES outputs a **single numerical score per model**, enabling straightforward ranking and selection.

ARES is typically used as a **post-prediction evaluation tool**, complementing RNA structure prediction methods by identifying the most plausible models from a candidate ensemble.

---

## Input Requirements

To make a prediction with ARES, users must submit **one of the following input types** (not both):

- **Rosetta silent file**  
  - Contains one or more candidate RNA structural models

**OR**

- **PDB file**  
  - May contain multiple RNA structural models

Each submitted file can include **multiple candidate structures**, all of which will be evaluated independently.

---

## Output

ARES produces:

- **A single score for each submitted model**
  - Lower score indicates a more favorable (higher-quality) RNA structure

The output can be used to:
- Rank candidate RNA models
- Select top-performing structures
- Compare results across different RNA structure prediction methods

---

## Example Use Case

- Generate multiple RNA 3D models using a structure prediction method (e.g., Rosetta-based modeling).
- Submit the resulting **PDB file** or **Rosetta silent file** to the ARES server.
- Use the ARES scores to identify the most plausible RNA 3D structure.

## Server Status Information

The ARES web server provides real-time job queue information, including:

- Number of models remaining in the current job
- Number of jobs waiting in the queue
- Optional email notification when results are available

---

## Key Features

- Neural network–based RNA structure evaluation
- Single-score output for easy model ranking
- Supports batch evaluation of multiple RNA models
- Compatible with Rosetta modeling workflows
- Web-based access to a trained evaluation model

---

## Usage Notes

- Input files must be either a Rosetta silent file **or** a PDB file (not both).
- ARES does **not** modify or refine structures; it only evaluates them.
- Best used in combination with RNA structure prediction or sampling pipelines.
